Early when you start your career the amount of work is a lot and it may make you feel overwhelmed, you have to stay patient and after this hardship is over you will enjoy work a lot more.\n\n# What do you like to do in your free time?\n\nIn my free time I would like to watch series, also I enjoy playing football and swimming. Other than these I also like going to the movies and billiard and table tennis.\n\n# What was the most useful lesson you learned early in your career?\n\nHaving a good teacher can really help. Unfourtanely I only had a teacher for one month when I was starting out, and I learned everything by self-study. So I think having a good teacher can be pretty useful even if it's going to cost you.\n\n# What could the industry be doing better in your opinion?\n\nIn my opinion the animation industry should move closer to becoming an ecosystem, if the potentials in this field are discovered, this industry will massively benefit from it.\n"},"relatedPosts":{"nodes":[{"id":"33ed9385-e23e-5364-bd0e-b82e30583602","frontmatter":{"title":"Alzahra Talents: Mohammad Afshanifarid","tags":["interview"],"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","backgroundColor":"#080818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/99b76ea32d5f40785946de329174a37b/6c5b8/2021-02-28-talents-mohammad-afshanifarid.jpg","srcSet":"/static/99b76ea32d5f40785946de329174a37b/f391e/2021-02-28-talents-mohammad-afshanifarid.jpg 750w,\n/static/99b76ea32d5f40785946de329174a37b/6c5b8/2021-02-28-talents-mohammad-afshanifarid.jpg 1080w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/99b76ea32d5f40785946de329174a37b/7f6a3/2021-02-28-talents-mohammad-afshanifarid.webp 750w,\n/static/99b76ea32d5f40785946de329174a37b/75ccc/2021-02-28-talents-mohammad-afshanifarid.webp 1080w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":1}}},"date":"2021-03-11"},"excerpt":"In this interview we are going to have a friendly discussion with one of talented senior artists, Mohammad Afshanifarid, Alzahra's Lead…","fields":{"slug":"alzahra-talents-mohammad-afshanifarid"}}],"totalCount":1}},"pageContext":{"title":"Alzahra Talents: Hamid Beheshtian","locale":"en","primaryTag":"interview","frontmatter":{"title":"Alzahra Talents: Hamid Beheshtian","image":"../img/2021-02-28-talents-mohammad-afshanifarid.jpg","date":"2021-05-10T10:00:00.000Z","tags":["interview"],"featured":true,"draft":true}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
