Injured in the crash, the secret of Ardalan's multiple marriages is suddenly unearthed, as his many wives vie for his attention. All from different backgrounds and with varying situations at home, the three women react very differently to the news, and as the inevitable comic clash reaches its height, Ardalan finds himself pulled in literally three different directions.

As the investigation continues, the cops find a burned car with an unidentifiable body in one of the northern roads of the country. Now, these three women are accused of kidnapping besides murder and…\n"}},"pageContext":{"title":"Women Are Incredible","locale":"en","primaryTag":"film","frontmatter":{"title":"Women Are Incredible","director":"Mehrdad Farid","release":"2010-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","image":"../../img/cinematic/2010-women-are-incredible.jpg","tags":["film","vfx"],"featured":false,"draft":true,"imdb":"tt8147158","youtube":"8HrSS1qTh40"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
